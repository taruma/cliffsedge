# Cliff's Edge (Visual Interpretation) Behind The Scenes

This repository is used for storing "behind-the-scenes" interpretations of the song "Cliff's Edge" by Taruma Sakti x Suno.

Currently, there are two interpretations of "Cliff's Edge": "A Visual Ballad of Despair" and "Shattered." "Shattered" is a reimagined and visually upgraded version of "A Visual Ballad of Despair." As a result, "Cliff's Edge: Shattered" replaces the "A Visual Ballad of Despair" version.

Disclaimer: Please be aware that the prompts used may not necessarily be replicable, and some images and shots in the final product could be anomalies. For those who wish to use these prompts, it is recommended to review and refine them.
