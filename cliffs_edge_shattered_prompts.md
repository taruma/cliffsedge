There's neatly folded dark coat resting on it. The ocean stretches out to the horizon, the sky a deep, dark blue, with a faint, warm glow remaining from the sunset. Waves crash gently against the rocks below, a soothing, rhythmic sound. A slight breeze rustles the grass around the bench, creating a sense of tranquility. The emptiness of the bench is poignant, but the lingering warmth in the sky hints at the peace.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Mystic 2.5          | A slow dolly-out movement on an empty bench overlooking the ocean, capturing the expansive view of the waves crashing against the cliffs. the scene is dark<br><br>+<br><br>zoom out and crane out                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Kling 1.6 Standard | Freepik   | 5s + 10s     |
