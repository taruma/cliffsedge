Here's a guide you must follow:

## I. Foundational Elements of Lyrics:

*   **Central Theme and Narrative:**
    *   **Determine the Theme:** What is the main message or story you want to convey? The theme could be love, loss, hope, struggle, reflection, or social issues.
    *   **Build the Narrative:** How will your story unfold from the beginning to the end of the song? Consider the sequence of events, conflicts, and resolution (if any).
*   **Emotional Development:**
    *   **Identify Emotions:** What emotions do you want to evoke in the listener?
    *   **Emotional Flow:** How will the emotions develop throughout the song? Will they increase, decrease, or change?

## II. Creative Lyric Techniques:

*   **Figurative Language:** Use language that goes beyond literal meaning to create a stronger and more engaging effect.
    *   **Metaphor:** An implicit comparison without using connecting words. Example: "Your heart is a deep ocean."
    *   **Simile:** An explicit comparison using words like "like," "as," or "as if." Example: "Her tears fell like rain."
    *   **Personification:** Giving human qualities to inanimate objects or abstract concepts. Example: "The wind whispered secrets."
    *   **Hyperbole:** An exaggerated statement for emphasis or dramatic effect. Example: "I will love you until the end of time."
    *   **Wordplay:** Using ambiguity, homophones, puns, or alliteration to create a clever or interesting effect. Example: "Where there's a *will*, there's a *way*."
*   **Imagery and Sensory Details:** Use words that evoke the senses (sight, hearing, smell, touch, taste) to make the lyrics more vivid and real. Example: "The aroma of coffee spreads in the cold morning."
*   **Diction (Word Choice):**
    *   **Context:** Choose words that are appropriate for the theme, emotion, and style of the song.
    *   **Variation:** Avoid excessive repetition of words, except for emphasis.
    *   **Active Verbs:** Use active verbs to make the lyrics more dynamic.
*   **Rhyme and Rhyme Scheme:**
    *   **Rhyme Pattern:** Determine the rhyme pattern for each part of the song (AABB, ABAB, ABCB, etc.).
    *   **Types of Rhyme:** Perfect rhyme (identical end sounds), imperfect rhyme (similar sounds).
    *   **Consistency:** Try to be consistent with the chosen rhyme scheme within one part of the song.
*   **Rhythm and Meter:**
    *   **Number of Syllables:** Consider the number of syllables per line to create a flowing rhythm.
    *   **Stress Pattern:** Pay attention to the stress pattern of syllables (e.g., iambic, trochaic) to create a musical rhythm.

## III. Song Structure Using Tags:

A structured approach to building a song using *tags* that identify the parts of the song:

1. **Song Skeleton:**
    *   Start with a basic structure: **[Intro]** ➡️ **[Verse]** ➡️ **[Chorus]** ➡️ **[Verse]** ➡️ **[Chorus]** ➡️ **[Bridge]** ➡️ **[Chorus]** ➡️ **[Outro]**
    *   Adjust according to your genre and musical style.

2. **Add Embellishments:**
    *   Consider adding **[Pre-Verse]**, **[Pre-Chorus]**, **[Post-Chorus]**, **[Hook]**, or **[Refrain]** for variation and emphasis.
    *   Think about instrumental parts: **[Instrumental]**, **[Solo]**.

3. **Genre-Specific Elements:**
    *   Use *tags* that are common in your genre, such as **[Drop]** for EDM or **[Beatbox]** for Hip-Hop.

4. **Transitions:**
    *   Use **[Interlude]** or **[Segue]** to smooth transitions between sections.

5. **Dynamics:**
    *   Utilize *tags* like **[Build-up]** and **[Breakdown]** to create interesting dynamic changes.

6. **Repetition and Variation:**
    *   Consider **[Reprise]** or **[Tag]** to add familiar elements with a different touch.

7. **Special Features:**
    *   Add unique elements like **[Spoken Word]**, **[Ad-lib]**, or **[Free Improvisation]** for an extra touch.

## IV. Specific Song Sections:

*   **[Intro]:** Creates the initial atmosphere of the song. Lyrics may be absent or consist of a short, catchy phrase.
*   **[Verse]:** Develops the narrative, provides details, or conveys information. The lyrics change in each *verse*.
*   **[Pre-Chorus]:** Builds tension and leads to the *chorus*. The lyrics often increase in intensity.
*   **[Chorus]:** The core of the song, the main message that is repeated. The lyrics should be *catchy* and memorable.
*   **[Post-Chorus]:** Provides a continuation after the *chorus*. It can be an additional *hook* or a transition.
*   **[Bridge]:** Provides a new perspective or a change of atmosphere. The lyrics are often different from other parts.
*   **[Outro]:** Closes the song, providing a conclusion or final impression.

## V. Genre Considerations:

Each music genre has different conventions for lyrics and structure. Consider these when writing:

*   **Pop:** Simple, relatable lyrics, focusing on love and relationships, very *catchy chorus*. Often uses **[Pre-Chorus]** and **[Post-Chorus]**.
*   **Rock:** Lyrics can be more poetic, using strong metaphors, themes of rebellion or intense love. Often uses a strong **[Bridge]** and **[Instrumental]** solo.
*   **Hip-hop/Rap:** Focus on wordplay, complex rhymes, and storytelling. Elements like **[Rap]**, **[Hook]**, **[Sample]**, and **[Scratch]** are common.
*   **R&B:** Lyrics about love, desire, and relationships, with an emphasis on emotion. **[Ad-lib]** is often used.
*   **Country:** Lyrics tell stories about everyday life, love, and traditional values. Often uses **[Refrain]**.
*   **EDM:** Minimalist or repetitive lyrics, serving to build energy. The structure often leads to a **[Drop]** through **[Build-up]** and **[Breakdown]**.

## VI. Additional Tips for AI:

*   **Use Tags for Structure:** Give structure instructions using *tags*. Example: "Create a song with the structure: **[Intro]** **[Verse 1]** **[Chorus]** **[Verse 2]** **[Chorus]** **[Bridge]** **[Chorus]** **[Outro]**."
*   **Associate Tags with Lyric Styles:** Provide examples of lyric styles that are suitable for each *tag*. Example: "In the **[Bridge]** section, use introspective and metaphorical lyrics."
*   **Limitations Based on Tags:** Give lyric limitations for each section. Example: "In the **[Chorus]** section, create a maximum of 4 memorable lines."
*   **Genre Exploration with Tags:** Ask the AI to generate lyrics in a specific genre, paying attention to common *tags*.
*   **Combine Tags:** Encourage the AI to experiment with combinations of *tags* for unique structures.
