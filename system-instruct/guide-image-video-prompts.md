# Consolidated Guidelines for "Cliff's Edge" Music Video Prompts

### I. Static Prompt Guidelines (Mystic 2.5)

**Purpose:** To generate the initial frame of a shot, setting the stage for the movement prompt. The Mystic 2.5 model thrives on detail and natural language.

**Structure:**

1. **Subject Description:**

    *   Clearly identify the main subject(s) using natural language **without using character names like "Michael" or "Ruff."** Instead, use descriptive phrases like "the man," "the figure," or "one of the solitary figures."
    *   Provide a detailed description of the subject's appearance, drawing from the "Michael's Appearance" section and the storyboard. Describe clothing, physical features, and any visible accessories from head to toe. **If the subject has appeared in previous shots, use the same detailed description to maintain consistency.**
    *   Specify the subject's posture and expression using evocative adjectives.
    *   Clearly indicate the subject's position within the frame (e.g., "sitting on the edge of the cliff, facing the ocean," "standing in the center of the frame, looking down").
2. **Environment/Background Description:**

    *   Describe the setting in detail, using natural language and drawing from the storyboard.
    *   Specify the time of day and weather conditions using descriptive terms (e.g., "at night, under a stormy, starless sky," "during a bright, sunny afternoon with gentle breezes").
    *   Include relevant details about the environment, painting a vivid picture (e.g., "a flickering neon sign casting an eerie glow on the rain-slicked street," "a sparsely furnished apartment with bare, off-white walls and a single, dim lightbulb").
3. **Composition:**

    *   Indicate the shot type from the storyboard (e.g., "Extreme Wide Shot," "Close Up," "Medium Shot").
    *   Specify the camera angle (e.g., "High Angle," "Eye-level," "Low Angle").
4. **Style and Mood:**

    *   Use keywords to describe the desired aesthetic (e.g., "dark," "cinematic," "realistic," "surreal," "dreamlike," "desaturated colors," "bright," "colorful").
    *   Refer to the "Visual Style" section of your project document and the "Theme/Mood" specified in each shot of the storyboard.
    *   You can mention specific artists or art styles if they align with your vision, but ensure they are described in natural language that Mystic 2.5 can interpret.
5. **Other Details:**

    *   Include any specific details from the storyboard that are crucial for the shot (e.g., "a single tear rolling down his cheek," "a framed photograph on a dusty table").

**Do's:**

*   **Be extremely specific and use precise, natural language.**
*   **Prioritize key elements** that need to be accurately represented in the initial frame.
*   **Reference the storyboard** for shot type, camera angle, and visual details.
*   **Convey the desired mood** using descriptive words.
*   **Experiment** with different prompt variations.
*   **Save good prompts** for later reuse or adaptation.

**Don'ts:**

*   **Be vague** or use ambiguous terms.
*   **Use overly technical jargon.**
*   **Use contradictory terms.**
*   **Forget the context** of the movement prompt that will follow.
*   **Use character names ("Michael," "Ruff") or refer to previous shots.** Each prompt should be self-contained.

### II. Movement Prompt Guidelines (Kling AI - Natural Language Emphasis)

**Purpose:** To describe the action and changes that occur within a shot, using the static prompt as the starting point and following Kling AI's formula, while employing natural, descriptive language.

**Structure:**

Kling AI emphasizes a simple and direct formula:

**Subject + Movement, Background + Movement**

However, this formula should be expressed in natural, descriptive English sentences. **Do not use bullet points or a list format.**

1. **Initial Context:** Briefly connect to the static prompt by mentioning the main subject and setting in a natural way, **without referring to "previous shots" or using character names**. (e.g., "A weary, middle-aged man in a dark suit stands on a windswept cliff," "A flickering neon sign reading 'Hello' illuminates a rainy, dark alley").
2. **Subject + Movement:**

    *   Describe the subject's actions using vivid, descriptive language and action verbs. **Do not use character names.**
    *   Focus on movements that are physically plausible and likely to occur in the image.
    *   Write in complete sentences: "The weary, middle-aged man slowly walks towards the edge of the cliff, his shoulders hunched against the wind."
3. **Background + Movement:**

    *   Describe changes in the background using evocative language that paints a picture.
    *   Focus on movements that are physically plausible and likely to occur in the image.
    *   Write in complete sentences: "The rain intensifies, plastering the man's hair to his forehead and soaking his dark suit. The wind whips around him, carrying the salty spray of the ocean."
4. **Camera Movement:**

    *   Clearly state the camera movement using natural language, as indicated in the storyboard.
    *   Write in complete sentences: "The camera slowly zooms out, revealing the vast expanse of the turbulent ocean below."

**Tips for Kling AI:**

*   **Use simple words and sentence structures,** but make them descriptive and evocative.
*   **Describe movements that are likely to occur in the image** and comply with the laws of physics.
*   **Avoid descriptions that significantly deviate from the image,** as this may cause a camera cut or transition.
*   **Complex physical movements** are challenging to generate at this stage.

**Do's:**

*   **Connect to the static prompt** naturally **without referring to previous shots**.
*   **Use the "Subject + Movement, Background + Movement" concept as a guide but express it in natural, descriptive sentences.**
*   **Employ vivid language** and action verbs to describe movements.
*   **Focus on realistic and physically plausible movements.**
*   **Clearly describe camera movements** in a natural way.
*   **Test and iterate** on prompts.

**Don'ts:**

*   **Overcomplicate the language.** Keep it natural but descriptive.
*   **Describe movements that are unlikely or impossible** in the given context.
*   **Deviate significantly from the static image** without expecting a potential cut or transition.
*   **Attempt to generate highly complex physical movements.**
*   **Forget the storyboard's intended action and camera movement.**
*   **Use robotic or formulaic language.** Write as if you're describing the scene to a person.
*   **Use character names or refer to previous shots.** Each prompt should be self-contained.

## III. Guide for Ensuring Continuity and Visual Storytelling

**Purpose:** To create a cohesive, emotionally impactful, and visually engaging music video.

**Key Principles:**

1. **Storyboard as Blueprint:** The storyboard is your primary guide. Follow its sequence of shots, narrative flow, and visual transitions.
2. **Consistent Visual Style:**

    *   Maintain a consistent visual style within each scene type (dream vs. reality). This includes lighting, color palette, and overall aesthetic. Refer to the "Visual Style" section of your project document.
    *   Use static prompts to establish the visual style for each scene, and ensure that the movement prompts maintain that style throughout the shot.
3. **Transitional Shots:**

    *   Pay close attention to the transitions between shots and scenes. The storyboard should indicate how one shot flows into the next.
    *   Use appropriate camera movements and visual cues to create smooth transitions.
    *   Movement prompts can be used to create transitions (e.g., "The scene fades to black," "The image dissolves into the next scene").
4. **Logical Flow of Action:**

    *   Ensure that the actions within each shot and across scenes follow a logical sequence.
    *   Movement prompts should build upon the previous shot's static prompt and lead into the next shot seamlessly.
5. **Character Consistency:**

    *   Maintain consistency in the appearance and behavior of the "Michaels" throughout the video.
    *   Use the "Michael's Appearance" section of your project document as a reference for your static prompts. Describe each "Michael" from head to toe.
    *   Ensure that the movement prompts are consistent with the established personality and emotional state of each "Michael."
6. **Environmental Continuity:**

    *   Pay attention to the details of the environment across shots and scenes.
    *   Ensure that the backgrounds, lighting, and weather conditions are consistent within each scene, unless a deliberate change is indicated in the storyboard.
7. **Emotional Arc:**

    *   Consider the emotional arc of the entire music video and how each shot contributes to it.
    *   Each shot should contribute to the overall feeling and message of the video, building towards a climax and resolution.
8. **Symbolism and Motifs:**

    *   Reinforce the use of recurring visual motifs like the cliff, the ocean, and the contrast between light/dark and dream/reality.
    *   Consistently use these symbols to represent the "Michael's" internal struggles and the themes of the story.
9. **Iterative Review:**

    *   After generating each shot, review it in the context of the preceding and following shots.
    *   Check for continuity errors, such as inconsistencies in lighting, character appearance, or background details.
    *   Make adjustments to the static and movement prompts as needed to correct any errors and improve the flow.
